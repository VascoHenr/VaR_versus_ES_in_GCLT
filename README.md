# VaR_versus_ES_in_GCLT

An example of Value at Risk (VaR) versus Expected Shortfall (ES) in a potential heavy-tailed World where the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT) directly plots daily variations in assets.

It consists of a single Python script file with one example and with comments. VaR and ES are calculated for an heavy-tailed Lévy alpha-stable simulation of an example asset as well as for the Gaussian particular case. The insight of footnote 8 of Basel's d457 explanatory document is replicated for both the Gaussian simulation and the heavy-tailed case. This reusable example also highlights how the VaR metric can be deceiving in an heavy-tailed World that only mildly departs from the Gaussian particular case of the GCLT. Percentile calculation in a sample, even if a very large sample (which is used to find the confidence interval to compute VaR), will lead to almost the same value for the Gaussian case as for the case of a Lévy alpha-stable distributed variable with alpha only slightly departing from the Gaussian. However, ES will differ significantly.
