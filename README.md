# VaR_versus_ES_in_GCLT

An example of Value at Risk versus Expected Shortfall under in an heavy-tailed world where the Generalized Central Limit Theorem directly plots daily variations in assets.

It consists of a single Python script file with one example and with comments. VaR and ES are calculated for an heavy-tailed LÃ©vy alpha-stable simulation of an example asset as well as for the Gaussian particular case. The insight of footnote 8 of Basel's d457 explanatory document is replicated for both the Gaussian simulation and the heavy-tailed case. This reusable example also highlights how the VaR metric can be deceiving in an heavy-tailed World that only mildly departs from the Gaussian particular case of the GCLT.
