# VaR_versus_ES_in_GCLT

An example of Value at Risk versus Expected Shortfall under in an heavy-tailed world where the Generalized Central Limit Theorem directly plots daily variations in assets.

It consists of a single Python script file with one example and with comments. VaR and ES are calculated including for an heavy-tailed simulation and footnote 8 of Basel's d457 explanatory document is retrieved for a Gaussian simulation and the heavy-tailed case.
